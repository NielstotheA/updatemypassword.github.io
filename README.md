Change My Password
==================

A directory of direct links to update your account's passwords.

Inspired by justdelete.me.

The sites, urls and additional notes are stored in sites.json. If you want to add a site to the list you'll need the following information:

- `name`: The name of the service
- `url`: The url that account to change the password. If such a page doesn't exists, the url should be a contact or help page explaining the process.
- `info`: *(optional)* Notes will be shown when someone hovers on that service. Notes may include additional information you might need to update your account's password.

Contribution checklist
----------------------

1. Have you updated to the lastest version of the project? `git pull`
2. If you have modified an existing service's difficulty, please explain why/give sources.
3. URLs must be direct links to either deletion, or if this is not available, a relevant help article.
4. Any steps for the process should be detailed in the info (if necessary).
5. Be sure to indent 4 spaces per level.
6. Be sure to place your entry ALPHABETICALLY in the current list.
7. Please test that your changes work by going to `localhost` or `localhost/index.html`
